Description: Kill password:
 By setting up a kill password, you gain the ability to render your encrypted data permanently inaccessible in emergency situations.
 .
 During the early boot phase, when prompted for your LUKS encryption passphrase, you can enter the kill password instead.

 WARNING! You MUST make a backup copy of the header of the volume you are protecting! WARNING!

 Rather than decrypting the partitions, the system will immediately erase the keyslots from the LUKS volume, making the data irrecoverable.
